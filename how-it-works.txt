pixel clock pulses column counter (top left)
    column counter counts 0-799, and then resets (on pulse 800 -> becomes pulse 0)

every time the column counter resets, the line counter is pulsed
    line counter counts 0-524, and then resets (on pulse 525 -> becomes pulse 0)

on the right, the top and bottom decoders look at the column/line numbers and decode hVis and hSync, and vVis and vSync, respectively
    the vis lines are high when the counters are on a visible column/line
    the sync lines are low during the vga sync times, and high otherwise

the pixel coordinate bus runs up the middle. Due to space/time constraints, only 16 bits are used for pixel coordinates instead of the full
    24. this leads to a configuration where every pixel in memory represents a 2x2 "real pixel" area, with 256x256 memory pixels available
    (512x512 real pixels)
    this bus addresses a 64k ROM (hopefully soon RAM) which stores color pixel data as 1 pixel (2x2 "real pixels") per byte, with colors
    assigned rrr ggg bb. 8 bit color mixing has yet to be implemented so for now it's just 3 bit color

the chips just above the timing decoder (7404 and 7408 in top right) take care of blacking out the color lines when the counters leave
    addressable or visible space. this ensures that unwriteable areas of the screen stay black and don't produce noise.

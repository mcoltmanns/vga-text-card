Column/line counter:
    25.175 MHz clock
    SN74HC161 x6
    SN74HC20N

Timing pulse generator:
    SN74HC04N x3 (need 3 instead of 2 beacuse have to invert top line of line counter)
    74HC58 x2 (obsolete, but available on digi-key, and seems to be around from small retailers)
        replaceable with a cd4048? yes. tie control lines high, then you get (ABCD) + (EFGH) (see data sheet).
        since these only get 1 function per ic, would need 4. cost-wise, the cd4048 costs ~1eur, and the 7458s are 1eur apiece + 2eur shipping.

        -> same cost but simpler wiring with the 7458
    CD74HC4075 x2

Pixel data generator:
    28c64b (or some equivalent fast EEPROM)
    resistors (for color lines):
        red/green lines: (3.3k 1.8k 1k) x2
        blue line: 1.2k 1k
        comes to total:
            3.3k x2
            1.8k x2
            1.2k x1
            1k x3 (have)

Lots of hookup wire (the good stuff! not that awful cheap stuff that snaps after 3 reconnects)
Couple breadboards

Power supply (should give up to 5v 1a from 7-15v input):
    LM7805 x1 (have several)
    100nf x1 (have several)
    10uf x1 (have several)
Or use any 5v supply

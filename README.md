# Concept for an 8-bit VGA character/video generator

This project is a collection of files describing a "breadboardable" VGA signal generator, which generates either color bitmap images or screens of text.
There are two branches - the main branch is the original version, designed to render 160x120 color bitmaps (with color encoding rrrgggbb). The text-mode branch describes an alternate design that would be able to render 80x60 characters. Neither version is complete, but the original is functional in simulations.
The device can be tested and the schematics edited with [hneeman's Digital simulation software](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).

## Main (original) branch
The original iteration of the device is fairly simple: VGA timing pulses are generated by counting clock pulses from the pixel clock. These timing pulses are also used to read pixel color information from the ROM, which is then passed through a DAC to get the analog color voltages. See how-it-works.txt for more information.
The img-convert.py script is a simple python script that accepts a png and converts it to the binary that the card can render.

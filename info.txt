operate in 800x600, pixel clock at 40mhz
but group pixels by 4! so effective resolution is 264x157, real clock at 10MHz

when not in visible area, can write to pixbuffer

column timing
	visible area - 200 columns - starts on 0, ends on 199 - high from 0 to b0 1100 0111
	sync - 10 columns - starts on 210, ends on 241  - low from b0 1101 0010 to b0 1111 0001
	reset on 264 - b1 0000 1000

	with columns as A BCDE FGHI - and s/r flipflops
	vis SET is on 0/counter reset, RESET is on BCF
	sync RESET is on BCEH, SET is on BCDEI
	counter reset is on AF
	Common? BC

lines are used to count vertical timing
	visible area - 150 lines - starts on line 0, ends on line 149 - high from 0 b1001 0101
	sync - starts on line 150, ends on line 151 - (hacky - timing is off line - but should maybe be ok?) - low from b1001 0110 to 1001 0111
	reset on 157 - b1001 1101

	with columns as ABCD EFGH - and s/r flipflops
	vis SET is on 0/counter reset, RESET is on ADFG
	sync RESET is on ADFG, SET is on ADE
	counter reset is on ADEFH
	Common? AD

video lines are only active when in visible area, otherwise low
hsync is only low during hsync pulse, otherwise high
vsync is only low during vsync pulse, otherwise 

two signals per axis:
- vis: high in visible area, low otherwise
- sync: low during sync, high otherwise
